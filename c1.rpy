  "Then a door to the right of yours opens, there's some more shuffling, and then it slams shut."

  "Twist, you open your door a bit, but it's too dark to make out much of anything. You see two figures carrying a third person in between them."
  "He's definitely struggling and you swear you can hear some\n :( Unkind Words :( being bandied about, but it's pretty quiet."
  "They throw open the door across from yours, throw the person inside, slam the door, and leave."

  "can Twist tell if the person looks or sounds injured?"
  "You catch a hint of white bandages. It's hard to tell if he's freshly injured though, since he was being held by the other guys."
