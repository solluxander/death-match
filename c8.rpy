  "Lysander is indeed around! It's getting to be afternoon by now, but he's passed out on one of the couches in the common room."
  "His limbs are sprawled out, one leg slung over the backrest of the couch, another hooked over the armrest, an arm hanging off the edge."
  "He is obviously unfamiliar with the concept of 'not taking up space.'"
  "He looks like he's having a nice little nap."
  show twist sad at mid_left
  "Twist nudges his leg with a shoe and then holds his breath."
  "He stirs... But then he shifts around, mumbles something unintelligible, and then turns so that his face is shoved into the back of the couch."
  "It doesn't look particularly comfortable, but apparently he's making it work."

  "Twist tries it again, a little harder this time."
  "His body jolts this time, and he sucks in the sharp breath of someone jerked unexpectedly into consciousness."

  l "Mn?"
  show twist smug
  "Twist narrows his eyes."

  "Lysander narrows his eyes as well, though it's much more of a confused squint when he does it."
  l "Huh?"
  t "Didn't bother to wake me up, did ya? I'm just some scared little kid you don't want taggin' along, right?"
  l "I'm..."
  "He squints harder, brow furrowing."
  "After a few moments of thinking, he groans and scrubs his hands over his face, trying to wake himself up more."
  "Unfortunately for him, he seems no less confused after this. But he tries anyway."
  l "I mean... I guess you got weird around Nadine that one time, but I didn't think you'd {i}want{/i} to hang out in the infirmary? Why do you even care?"
  t "No, not-"
  "He grabs Lysander's shoulder and leans in, bringing his voice down."
  t "m'talking about the escape plan, you blighter"
  "Lysander doesn't seem too bothered by the touch, though he does lean back when Twist gets too close."
  "He also, tragically, remains confused."
  l "Oh. That makes more sense... I think."
  l "But what's that have to do with last night?"
  "Twist bares his teef."
  t "I {i}waited{/i} for you!"
  "Lysander's brows raise in mild alarm at Twist's sharp little teeth being flashed at him again."
  "But indignation makes him soldier on, despite the kid leaning over him with his freaky teeth!"
  l "I thought you were {i}asleep!{/i}"
  "he shoots back, still a little unsure why he's being attacked this early in the morning (at the unholy hour of (checks watch) like noon thirty)."

  "Twist looks a little unsure of himself, all of a sudden!"

  l "No??"

  l "I snuck out of {i}here{/i}" 
  "He gestures to the common area."
  l "But I didn't try to {i}leave.{/i} I just went downstairs to keep Brand company."
  t "Oh." 
  "He awkwardly lets go of Lysander's shoulder and just kinda. Stands there -  like a sim who's actions have just been canceled."
  t "Well- I'm not scared, so. Just- bring me along next time, ok?"
  l "That... was the plan, yeah."
  "He rubs the grit out of his eyes, looking Twist over."
  l "You're making a really big deal about not being scared. Are you feeling okay?"
  show twist smug
  "Twist gets very Tense and Rigid."
  t "I'm {i}fine{/i}."
  t "Just- you go back to sleep ok?"
  "Lysander streeeeeeeeeeetches out, then stands up."
  "He leans back against the arm of the couch so that he's at least {i}kind of{/i} on the same level as Twist."
  l "Nah, I'm up now. But if you wanna go over the plan again, we can do that."
  "He gestures in the direction of his room, where the picture he drew of the arena is."
  show twist sad
  t "Sure. Ok."
  "Twist still looks tense, but not hostile."
  l "Okay," 
  "Lysander repeats slowly."
  "He's crossing his arms, looking down at Twist like he's trying to solve a problem and coming up blank."
  l "You sure you're good?"
  show twist smug
  "Twist makes a hasty gesture."
  t "Come {i}on{/i}. Before you change your mind."
  l "Why would I change my—?"
  "He sighs."
  l "It's too early for this. Fine, come on." 
  "He leads Twist to his room and pulls out the plans."

  "Over the roar, you can hardly hear the sound of stone giving way as Nadine and Brand rush through a newly-made opening in the coliseum walls."
  "Nadine points Brand toward Barley first, while she goes for Lily."
  "Once the least fresh of the knock-outs are confirmed to be stable, they move to check on Karn and his brutally stabbed victims."
  "Brand and Nadine both seem moderately shocked when they find out that none of it had been real."

  "As penance for his deception, Ekene, the strongest of everyone there, is sent to drag Barley's unconscious body through the opening in the wall, which leads to the infirmary."
